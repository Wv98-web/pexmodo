            "qs_answer": "<p>A: This is a good question. We have also thought about how we can help everyone express themselves? Actually, we need a product, or a “carrier”, to realize the characteristics of an individual. In fact, we also thought of other things like electronics, collectibles, etc. But the advantage of clothing is that everyone needs to wear clothes to go out. No matter what industry the person is in, or what a compelling story he has, he must be in front of people in clothes that match his identity. Therefore, clothing has naturally become what we call this \"carrier\". We hope that clothing is not only just needed in life, but also expresses consumers' attitudes towards life and the world.<\/p>",

            "qs_answer": "<p>A: I don't think one style or type is always good. You'll often hear people say that fashion is a cycle, and that many styles come and go in cycles. If we compare the past few decades, we will find that there are many fashion elements that disappear for a while and then make a comeback. There are also some new elements that are produced with the development of society and the times, such as cyberpunk. The good news is that we have more and more choices, and people's tolerance for \"exotic clothes\" has increased a lot. We hope that our products can let more people know about different popular elements, even if it is very niche, which is why our products don't seem to be uniform (laughs).<\/p>",

These hoods are all handcrafted by us, and each hood takes about three hours. They're unique, you won't see them anywhere online. In this way, we hope that consumers will remember us. Currently we have four hoods, maybe we will make some other images later. We hope that the diverse hoods can show a variety of collocations.<\/p>",
